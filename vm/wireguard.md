# WireGuard - Alpine 

## Installation

A nice guide to install and configure wireguard on an alpine distribution can be found
[here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-set-up-wireguard-vpn-server-on-alpine-linux/).

## Operating WireGuard

[WGRest](https://github.com/suquant/wgrest) is a REST API controller for Wireguard.
The project is very promissing and should be considered for future use cases.
